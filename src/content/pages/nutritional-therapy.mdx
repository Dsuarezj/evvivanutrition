### What is Nutritional Therapy?

Nutritional therapy focuses on the overall nutrient value of a client’s diet to ensure the optimal wellbeing and sustained health. The therapy also encompasses lifestyle and environmental factors that might contribute to or detract from ultimate wellbeing. During this process, a client is educated as to the benefits of dietary and lifestyle intervention, so that they can feel empowered to take charge of their own health following the necessary amount of consultations. A common question asked is who might visit a Nutritional therapist? The answer is simple – anybody! From those that want to simply improve their overall diet to an individual with more chronic health conditions.

### What happens in a consultation with a Nutritional Therapist?

A nutritional therapist will normally assign an initial first-time appointment that is between 60 to 90 minutes in length. During this time a detailed case history from you is taken and this will give the nutritional therapist a sound idea of your health from a nutritional viewpoint. As part of the consultation, a nutritional therapist will ask you about diet, lifestyle, sleep quality, bowel movements, general habits and behaviours. This information will help the nutritional therapist understand where nutritional support can be provided and thus personalised to you. After your initial consultation, the nutritional therapist will create dietary recommendations and a lifestyle plan personalised for you. This may include dietary modifications, lifestyle and environmental adjustments. The nutritional therapist may also recommend specific supplements or laboratory tests. Follow up Nutritional Therapy consultations tend to be shorter and can last between 45 minutes to an hour depending on the complexity of your health goals. All data shared with a Nutritional Therapist is confidential and protected by strict data protection rules. Practitioners never recommend nutritional therapy as a replacement for medical advice and always refer any client with ‘red flag’ signs or symptoms to their medical professional. They will also frequently work alongside a medical professional and will communicate with other healthcare professionals involved in the client’s care to explain any nutritional therapy program that has been provided.

<Accordion client:load title="What is this image of a tree?">

n order to keep a tree healthy and allow it to flourish, you need to support the foundation first: the roots and soil. Similarly, if a tree is not healthy, the first place you should look for answers is those same foundational elements. The same approach applies to patients. The most important factors and the ones we examine first when gathering information about the patient are the foundational lifestyle factors; sleep, exercise, nutrition, stress levels, relationships, and genetics. These are the roots and soil, which are in turn influenced by specific predisposing factors, discrete events, and ongoing physiological processes, and may then result in fundamental imbalances at the trunk. These can eventually result in the signs and symptoms represented by the branches and leaves.
